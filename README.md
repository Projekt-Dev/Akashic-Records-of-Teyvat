# Akashic Records of Teyvat

An all in one program for your needs when playing Genshin Impact. Coded in Visual Basic

## Features

Some known features of this program are:

* ***Farmables:*** Knowing what is farmable each day from characters to weapons
* ***Builds:*** Don't know how to build your character? Well, this has some builds you can get an idea from!
* ***Exp Calculator:*** Don't know how many books it takes to get to a certain level? Here's how.
* ***Character Info:*** Want to know more about a character? Their skills? Lisa's Birthday? Let it be known who you simp for.
* ***Weapon Info:*** Want to know what a certain weapon does? What happens when they're refined? 


## Future Plans

* I would like to expand on the *exp calculator* by letting you input your current exp and telling you from then on how many books you need.
* Once the program is finished make the repository public.
* Create a new section called **Browse** where it gives the user some websites to go to for more information than what could be displayed inside the program such as interactive map.
* Find suggestions from the public and see if something like this should continue to be developed.
* Create a feedback system within the program where it will send me emails from within the program.
